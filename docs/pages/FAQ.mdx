# Frequently Asked Questions

## What networks does Klaster support?

Klaster supports multiple EVM-compatible networks, including major chains and layer 2 solutions. For the most up-to-date list, check the `/info` endpoint of a Klaster node.

## How does Klaster's chain abstraction work?

Klaster allows users to execute transactions across multiple chains with a single signature. It uses a network of nodes to handle cross-chain gas payments and transaction execution.

## Do users have the same address across chains with Klaster?

Yes, Klaster uses deterministic address derivation to provide users with the same smart contract wallet address across all supported chains.

## How much does using Klaster cost?

Klaster nodes charge a fee for executing transactions, which is included in the quote provided to users. The exact cost depends on the complexity of the transaction and current gas prices.

## Who holds the keys in the Klaster system?

Users retain full control of their keys. Klaster never has access to user funds or private keys.

## How does Klaster handle transaction signing?

Users sign a single interchain transaction (iTx) hash, which represents multiple transactions across different chains. This signature authorizes the Klaster network to execute the entire bundle of transactions.

## What happens if a Klaster node fails to execute a transaction?

Klaster uses a slashing mechanism to penalize nodes that fail to execute committed transactions, ensuring reliability and security for users.

## How does Klaster improve blockchain usability?

Klaster simplifies multi-chain interactions, handles gas payments across different networks, and allows users to pay fees in various tokens, reducing complexity for end-users and developers.
